			</div>

			<p> I have walked through my share of doors. Often, with the door
				slamming behind me and I feel myself in an empty dark place. <br>

				<p> </p>

				When the less happy doors open for you, and you are shoved through them,
				remember you will be walking through a jollier door before you know it.

			<p> The doorways that lead to happiness can be harder to find but that is true
				for a reason. If we constantly walked through doors painted in colors of joy,
				we wouldn’t appreciate them, would we?<br>
				<p> </p>
				If you are lucky and blessed, you will spend your days on the positive side of doors.
				But most of us must spend some time in the darker places, the ugly doors, to fully enjoy
				the brighter ones. Life is a hard one, as much of us know. I believe how you spend your
				dark days, as well as the time spent after the fact reflecting, has a lot to do with how
				many brighter days you enjoy.

			<p> The metaphor for a door is a heavy one. It carries a lot of weight and sometimes that weight is on your
				shoulder.<br>

					“A very little key will open a very heavy door.” <br>– Charles Dickens, Hunted Down<br>
				</div>

				Dickens knew of these heavy doors.<br>
				<p> </p>
				Life is full of doors, opening and closing along the way.<br>
				<p> </p>
				This could not be truer. That door. It opens. It closes. And it always opens again.
				Be patient and it will open. And when it does, skip right through it and enjoy life.
				Enjoy life, but realize how the not-so-happy times have a place, also. These times help
				us grow. They help us learn about ourselves. They help us better ourselves. It is never
				enjoyable to be going through a bad time, but when you come through it, through that door,
				you have changed. You need to embrace the change and learn from it. If you do learn–you
				will be stronger and better for it.<br>
				<p> </p>
				Yes, life makes us strong. Life gives us weight to carry around so we can be tough and open
				those doors. All those doors.

			<p> Be curious, as well. When you get pushed through a few bad doors, you become weary of all doorways. Keep moving.
				Keep looking for new doors.<br>
				<p> </p>
				Walt Disney never let a door slam in his face. “We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things,
				because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”<br>
				<p> </p>
				When you are enjoying life, it is much easier to see the bright side to door-openings and door-closings. It is
				always easier on the other side. Looking back, you can learn from one bad door to the next. As well, as learn from
				the positive doors.<br>
				<p> </p>
				Elizabeth Taylor spoke of this. “I feel very adventurous. There are so many doors to be opened, and I’m not afraid
				to look behind them.”<br>
				<p> </p>
				<p> </p><br>

				<div id="quote2">
					Don’t be afraid of opening and closing doors. Don’t fear them. Learn from them.<br>
				</div>

				<p> </p><br>

				<p> </p>
				Be tall, be strong, and you will make it through that doorway when life pushes you through it. And be tall and
				strong again, when you flitter-flutter through the next door. Be an opener of doors, and embrace where they lead
				you.<br>
				<p> </p>
				I hope for you many happy doors, a few not-so-great doors, because we have to learn, and no scary, heavy doors.
				Life’s doors are full of lessons. Embrace them all.<br>
